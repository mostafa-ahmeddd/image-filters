****Image Processing Project****


***Overview***

This project focuses on applying various filters to images to enhance, modify, or extract specific features. The project includes a collection of image processing algorithms that can be used to apply different types of filters such as blur, sharpen, edge detection, and more.

***Features***

Blur Filters: Apply Gaussian blur, average blur, and median blur to images

**Sharpen Filters:** Enhance image details using sharpening filters.

**Custom Filters:** Define and apply custom convolutional filters to images.
